# Analyzing factors that contribute to student academic success.

Tools Used
Render_template, BluePrint and request. 
Render_template module was used to load html files into localhost. 
Blueprint module was employed to connect different .py files to our program. 
Request module was used to gather data from the html forms. 
Owlready2 – This python library was used to create and populate our own ontology based on our data sources. 
Pandas – Was used to structure and manipulate our datasets. 
Matplotlib – Was used to help visualize the data. 
Flask-DotEnv - Was used to provide support to .env files for our project
